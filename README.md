# STM32 F4 Faust synthesizer

This is source code for my STM32 F4 Faust synthesizer prototype. It's quite messy, there are lots of TODOs and FIXMEs, but it works. Most importantly though, it shows that Faust can be easily integrated with pretty much anything.

Here are a couple of videos of the synthesizer in action:
